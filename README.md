# C-DataStructures-Algorithms

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms in C

## Documentation

The Documentation is based on Doxygen. You can view it in the source code or run doxygen to generate a documentation for you (just make sure you change line 61 (output directory) and line 794 of the ```Doxygen``` file (the path for the source code)) or generate a new configuration using doxywizard.

## Current to-dos

### Hight Priority

* Document this shit up!
* Make a ```Clock``` structure for timing code (wrapping ```clock_t```) + Documentation
* Add all prime related functions + Documentation

### Medium Priority

* Separate tests into testing units for I/O and other specific things
* Work on empty structures like ```AVLTree``` and ```SparseMatrix```
* Add mathematical algorithms

### Low Priority

* Make a ```HashSet```'s buffer have a dynamic size
* Decide what the heck I'm going to do with ```Vector``` structure

### Long-term

* Create a library-like structure
* Document __EVERYTHING__
